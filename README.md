# 🧠 Path to Cognitive Security: Understanding Tech, Misinformation & Children

Welcome to my evolving research and exploration into **cognitive security**—specifically as it relates to **children and their interaction with technology**. This project is a personal and professional pursuit aimed at breaking down the influence of **misinformation**, **social engineering**, and **digital exposure** on developing minds.

- 📜 **CompTIA Security+**
- 🏢 **Microsoft Certified: Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals**

Alongside my foundational experience, I’m:

## 💡 Why I Care

My biggest motivation? **My family**.

I’ve seen how **vulnerable kids** are as they begin using phones, tablets, and the internet earlier and earlier. On the other side, I’ve also seen how **our elders struggle** to adapt to rapidly evolving tech.

We’re at a crucial point where guidance is more important than restriction.

I want to help parents, educators, and curious technologists understand:
- Why children gravitate toward certain content
- How misinformation spreads through platforms they use
- What role we can play in keeping them **safe, curious, and informed**
